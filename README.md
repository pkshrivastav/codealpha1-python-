# 1 Hangman Game
A text-based Hangman game written in Python. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player guesses one letter at a time to reveal the word.
A limited number of incorrect guesses are allowed before the game is lost.
Features
Random word selection from a list of words.
Limit on incorrect guesses to increase challenge.
Displays guessed letters and remaining attempts.
Encourages players to guess letters strategically.
How to Play
Run the program to start a new game.
The program will select a word randomly, represented by underscores (_).
Enter one letter per guess.
If the letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscore(s).
If not, you lose one attempt.
Continue guessing until:
The entire word is revealed (you win).
You run out of attempts (you lose).
